# The Squid Engineer's Toolkit
**"You cannot build a starship with a hammer."**

This is the definitive list of tools you need to build the Squid Drone. Do not try to "wing it" with dad's old plumbing soldering iron.

## 1. The Critical Essentials (Buy These First)

### 1.1 The Soldering Iron (Temperature Controlled)
*   **The Budget Hack:** **Go to a Library or Makerspace.**
    *   The "Big Solder" (Battery Pads + Capacitor) requires high heat (400°C) and a large tip. A cheap $15 iron cannot do this.
    *   Instead of buying a $60 Pinecil, find a local "FabLab" or University Lab. Use their Hakko/Weller station for 1 hour to do the heavy lifting.
    *   *If you must buy:* TS101 or Pinecil (Portable, USB-C).

### 1.2 The Magic Goo: Flux
*   **Requirement:** **"No-Clean Flux Pen"** or Syringe.
*   **The Secret:** Solder naturally wants to ball up and fall off. Flux cleans the metal chemically and makes solder flow like water.
*   **Rule:** If you are soldering, you are using flux. Every time.

### 1.3 The Solder
*   **Requirement:** **63/37 Leaded Solder** (Rosin Core).
*   **The Controversy:** Lead-Free is safer but harder to use. For your first build, get Leaded. Wash your hands. Don't eat it.

### 1.4 The Multimeter
*   **Requirement:** Any cheap digital multimeter ($10 on Amazon).
*   **Must Have:** **"Continuity Mode"** (The Beep).
*   **Usage:** You will use this 100 times to check for short circuits before plugging in the battery.

## 2. Controllers (The "Stick" Interface)

### 2.1 The Simulator Controller
*   **Option A (Free):** Xbox or PS4/PS5 Controller. Works fine for learning the "Virtual Dyno" and `gym-pybullet-drones`.
*   **Option B (Pro):** Use your real Radio connected via USB.

### 2.2 The Real Radio (Mandatory for Flight)
*   **Requirement:** A radio with **ELRS (ExpressLRS)** support.
*   **Recommendation:** **Radiomaster Pocket (ELRS Version)** (~$65).
    *   It's cheap, portable, and runs EdgeTX.
    *   *Warning:* Do not buy the "CC2500" version unless you know what you are doing. Get ELRS.

## 3. The Build Tools

### 3.1 Hex Drivers (1.5mm & 2.0mm)
*   **Requirement:** High-quality steel.
*   **The Trap:** The tiny L-shaped keys that come with furniture are garbage. They strip screws. Buy a dedicated screwdriver set.

### 3.2 The "Smoke Stopper"
*   **Requirement:** A resettable fuse or bulb device (XT30/XT60).
*   **Usage:** Plugs between battery and drone. Saves your electronics ($10 insurance for a $150 drone).

### 3.3 Wire Strippers (Optional)
*   **Hack:** For the 30 AWG silicone wire, your **fingernails** are sharp enough to pinch and pull the insulation off.
*   **Hack:** For the 24 AWG power wire, a sharp pair of scissors (used carefully) works fine. You don't *need* a $20 stripper tool.

## 4. Consumables

*   **Heat Shrink Tubing:** Assorted sizes (1mm, 2mm, 3mm, 5mm). Black is standard.
*   **Blue Loctite (243):** Threadlocker for metal screws.
*   **Electrical Tape:** For quick insulation (Liquid Electrical Tape is even better).
*   **Zip Ties:** The smallest ones you can find (2mm wide).

---

## 4. The "Nice to Haves" (Luxury)

*   **Helping Hands:** A stand with alligator clips to hold the board while you solder.
*   **Magnifying Glass / Headlamp:** These components are microscopic.
*   **Silicon Conformal Coating:** To waterproof your electronics (Apply ONLY after everything works).
