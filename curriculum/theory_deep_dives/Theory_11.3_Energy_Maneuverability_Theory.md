# Theory Deep Dive 11.3: Energy-Maneuverability (E-M)
**"The Physics of the Dogfight."**

In a dogfight, the drone with the most energy usually wins. Energy isn't just your battery; it is your **Altitude** and your **Velocity**.

---

## **1. Specific Total Energy ($H_e$)**
$$H_e = h + \frac{V^2}{2g}$$
*   **$h$:** Altitude (Potential Energy).
*   **$V$:** Velocity (Kinetic Energy).
*   **$g$:** Gravity.

---

## **2. Specific Excess Power ($P_s$)**
This is the rate of change of your energy.
$$P_s = \frac{Thrust - Drag}{Weight} \cdot V$$
*   If $P_s > 0$: You are gaining energy (accelerating or climbing).
*   If $P_s < 0$: You are "bleeding" energy (turning hard or fighting drag).

---

## **3. The Dogfighing Trade-off**
To intercept a target, you often have to perform a "High-G" turn.
*   **The Cost:** Turning creates **Induced Drag**. 
*   **The Strategy:** An elite interceptor code doesn't just turn as hard as possible. It calculates the **Corner Speed**—the exact speed where the drone can turn the sharpest without stalling its motors or falling out of the sky.

**Pilot Pro-Tip:** Never enter a fight "slow and low." You have no energy to trade for maneuvers.
