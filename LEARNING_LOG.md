## 🧠 The Break-out Strategy: The "Why" behind the "DEEP" Path
*Pedagogical reasoning for going from-scratch in specific modules.*

| Break-out Point | The "Boss" (Core Concept) | Pedagogical "Why" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Module 1: Motor Mixer** | Matrix Geometry | If you don't derive the mixer, you don't understand how the drone's physical shape affects its flight stability. |
| **Module 5: PID** | Discrete Calculus | Implementing PID from scratch teaches you about "Integral Wind-up" and "Derivative Kick"—real-world physics that libraries often hide. |
| **Module 5.2: MPC** | Real-Time Optimization | Moving from "Reactive" to "Predictive." Writing the iLQR solver is the difference between being a coder and being a control engineer. |
| **Module 7: EKF** | Covariance Tracking | Understanding how to weight a "guess" vs. a "measurement." If you don't write the matrix math, the Kalman filter remains "magic." |
| **Module 13: VIO** | Image Gradients | Learning how a computer "sees" motion at the pixel level. You'll master the Hessian matrix and Lucas-Kanade logic. |
| **Module 15.5: Edge AI** | Bit-Precision | Understanding how high-level "thoughts" (AI) fit into low-level "pipes" (INT8 hardware). Essential for the "Edge" in Edge AI. |

## 📈 Session History

### **Session 1: Dec 30, 2025**
*   **Status:** Curriculum Audited & Hardened.
*   **Breakthroughs:** Synced the Syllabus with the actual directory structure. Identified the "Forensics" gap.
*   **The "Wall":** Realized that "Joe Hobby" paths are too surface-level; decided on the "Math-to-Metal" exhaustive approach.
*   **Next Up:** Phase I, Module 0.2 (The Physics of Flight) & Thrust-to-Weight Math.
